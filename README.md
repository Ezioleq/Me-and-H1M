>It's about you (the guy in yellow helmet) and your friendly drone (the blue one).
>His name is H1M and will protect you from bullets. Your task is to finful his power needs or he will die (kinda, it's a drone). Just Me and Him.
>A collaborative experience in which you and your friend have to protect each other!

My first ever project made in Godot, second game made for a game jam.
Code is trash, gameplay isn't anything original but it was a great opportunity finally to learn some Godot.
